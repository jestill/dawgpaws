// Apollo configuration file. This defines the location of files needed by

// Both slash-star and slash-slash comments are accepted.

//
// The currently used keys are:
//   AdapterHistoryFile - path to data adapter history file
//   AutosaveFile       - the name of the autosave (backup) file
//   AutosaveInterval   - how often auto save occurs
//   DataAdapterInstall - class name:string name of data adapters to be
//                        dynamically loaded. Followed by a style to 
//			  to use for that data adapter.			
//   JavaPath           - Path to the directory where bin/java lives
//                        (e.g., on linux java is in /usr/lib/java/bin/java,
//                        so JavaPath is /usr/lib/java).
//			  Used by bin/apollo startup script.
//   Memory             - Max amount of memory Apollo is allowed to use
//                        (applies only when you launch Apollo via bin/apollo)
//   BrowserProgram     - path to your web browser program (e.g. /usr/local/netscape)
//                        if you don't use the default browser.
//
//   SiteShowLimit
//   FastDrawLimit
//   TextAvoidLimit
//
//   FrameOrientation	- Orientation of feature detail panel (default is horizonal;
//                        vertical is also an option)

//  Don't forget, a line or part of a line that starts with // will be ignored.

// On Solaris, java is /bin/java, thus JavaPath is just "/"
// On Linux, java is /usr/lib/java/bin/java, thus JavaPath is /usr/lib/java
// On Mac OS X, java is /usr/bin/java, thus JavaPath is /usr
// It would probably make more sense to have JavaPath be the actual path to java, e.g.
// /usr/lib/java/bin/java, but that would make this apollo.cfg incompatible with
// the Berkeley version.
// Note: if JavaPath is commented out, bin/apollo searches for the Java
// in your path.  Set JavaPath if you want to use a different Java.
// Also note:  JavaPath is only used if you run bin/apollo.  If you run the
// installed version of Apollo, it decides for itself where to find java.
